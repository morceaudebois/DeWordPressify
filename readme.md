Debrandify (formerly DeWordPressify) is a toolkit plugin that adds plenty of settings to customise and improve WordPress. You'll be able to remove WordPress' branding and replace it with your own as well as get rid of some of the bloat that comes built-in. Here's the key features:

- ✨ Customise the WordPress dashboard and emails with your own branding instead of WordPress', remove or replace WordPress logos and texts
- 🗑 Disable WordPress features such as comments, RSS feeds, emojis, REST API, WP Embeds and much more
- 🌐 Fully compatible with Multisite (control network options and per-site options at the same time)
- 🌎 Internationalised (available in French 🥖)
- 👀 High quality and lightweight with a solid user experience

## 📚 User guide 

### How to install Debrandify with custom default settings

You might want to install Debrandify on multiple websites without having to customise your settings on every single one of them. If so, there is an easy way!

1. Get ahold of the Debrandify plugin. You can either download a [release](https://github.com/morceaudebois/debrandify/releases/tag/1.0) from this repo or simply get it from the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder on a website where it's already installed.
2. Once you have the plugin, navigate to `/src/php/` in it and open the `functions.php` file.
3. The first thing you'll see should be the `dbrdify_getDefaultOptions()` function. This is where default options are defined, each line corresponding to a toggle/field of the Debrandify settings page.
4. Simply edit each line you want customised, `'yes'` being toggled and `'no'` being untoggled. 
5. Save the file and upload the plugin to your new site (either zip it and upload it through the WordPress dashboard, or put it in the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder)
6. Activate it and that's it! Debrandify should be initialised with your custom settings.
